> READ SECURITY ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS AND DELETE THIS SECTION BEFORE SUBMITTING THE ISSUE:
>
> All security issues need to have an **assignee** and a **priority label**.
>
> - Why? This is required for SoC2 compliance.
> - Who do I assign this to? If nobody offers themselves as a volunteer then assign yourself at first and then talk to your team-lead to decide what's next. Do no leave the issue unassigned! 
> - How to decide the priority? Use `p0`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` where `p0` is the highest priority and `p3` is the lowest.
> - How to determine the priority? It’s like porn: you know it when you see it. Just use common sense. Ex: `p0` is when there is a privilege escalation issue like getting shell access, `p3` can be something like an old security SSL cypher that is backwards compatible with IE11 or something.
